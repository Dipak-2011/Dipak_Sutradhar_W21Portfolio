                <h3>Project Vision</h3>
                <br>
                      <p>
                        Lack of appropriate parking demotivated people to use their vehicle to come to campus. Consequently, 
                        few people are forced to take subways or park their cars on the street far away and take a walk to the 
                        campus spending more time in their visit as well as end up paying fines for wrong parking locations or 
                        exceeding the parking timings. This website is design for them. Our objective was to build a cost effective, 
                        generalizable time efficient, ecofriendly safe, parking reservation web app. This would suffice the need of
                         corporate client and make parking management faster, well ordered and user friendly. Some of remarkable 
                         features are Check parking spot, Reserve, Prepayment/Post-Payment, Reminder of arrival and expiration time,
                          Cancellation, Reminder of arrival and expiration time and cancellation.

                    <h3>Project Plan</h3>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        We are going to create a car parking reservation web app that will run on web browser. For that reason, 
                        we need to ensure that the framework does not crash and require to have an internet connection all the 
                        time without any interruption. Now a days, react is very popular to create web application, which is an 
                        open source, front end, JavaScript library for building user interfaces or UI components. We select react
                         and NodeJS because we think it will help us to understand the technology better and we are already working
                          with react and NodeJS as a part of our study. So, we could get any help from our professor or classmate 
                          anytime when we need help.

                        Today, ReactJS is the exceptionally utilized open-source JavaScript Library. It helps in making amazing web 
                        applications that require negligible exertion and coding. The primary target of ReactJS is to create User 
                        Interfaces (UI) that improves the speed of the applications. There are significant upsides and downsides of
                         ReactJS given as following.

                                    ReactJS is much easier to learn and use than any other language. There are lots of documentation, tutorials, and training resources
                                     are available in online. Anyone who knows JavaScript background can easily understand. 
                                  </p>

                                    For dynamic web application, ReactJS is a good option because it provides less coding and gives more functionality. It supports the 
                                    building of machine-readable codes. ReactJS utilizes the JSX (JavaScript Extension), which is a specific syntax letting HTML statements
                                     and HTML quotes to render specific subcomponents.
                                  </p>
                                  <p>
                                    A web application of ReactJS is created by multiple components, and each of them have their own control and logic. These components are
                                     liable for the output of small piece of Html Code which can be reused wherever we need them.
                                  </p>

                                  <p>
                                    ReactJS offers a scope to test the codes with native tools.
                                  </p>
